# Naive-Bayes-Predict-NBA-Players

### Project Overview

  The Goal of this project is to build a Naive Bayes model that predicts whether a player will have an NBA career lasting five years or more.
  The model performed with 69% accuracy and 84% precision.

### Business Understanding
  The league is interested in retaining players who can last in the high-pressure environment of professional basketball and help the team be successful over time.
  We were asked to build a model that predicts whether a player will have an NBA career lasting five years or more.

### Data Understanding
  The data for this project consists of performance statistics from each player's rookie year. There are 1,341 observations, and each observation in the data represents a different player in the NBA. Our target variable is a Boolean value that indicates whether a given player will last in the league for five years.

### Conclusion
  Notably, the model performed better at predicting true positives than it did at predicting true negatives. In other words, it more accurately identified those players who will likely play for more than five years than it did those who likely will not.
